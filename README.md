# cs2261projects
Compilation of projects completed in GaTech CS 2261, Media Devices Architecture.

Disclaimer: Your teacher isn't stupid. They will find this repository. Don't copy and paste my code and submit it as your own to any class at any school.

The projects in this course are a series of GBA games in C. To compile them and play them yourself, you'll need Docker and mGBA Emulator, but everything else you need should be in tasks.json and Makefile already. 

Homework01: Animation Player
Homework02: Pong++
Homework03: Game in Mode 3 [Open Ended] (In Progress)
